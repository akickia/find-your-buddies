# Group project in IT:Tech for women

This is a group project that I was part of in spring 2022, but we didn't use this repo, so you can not see all commits. 
We worked together to create a game and practised using state, fetching via API, using JSON-server and mush more. 
It was a great challenge but we are proud that we made it work! 

There is no functionallity regarding login/signup yet.
